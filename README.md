# ElleHacks2018
The hosting platform for the ElleHacks site from 2018.

The site can be viewed at [connordear.ca/ElleHacks2018](https://connordear.ca/ElleHacks2018).

Since building this site, I've learned a lot about advantages/disadvantages of using flexbox for responsive webpages. I think it actually turned out pretty well, but the sponsors section could have benefitted from CSS-Grid. Also I didn't know a lot about animations at the time, but looking back, the site could definitely have benefitted from some.
